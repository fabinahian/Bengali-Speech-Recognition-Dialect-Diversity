## Competition Overview
The competition aims to develop a solution system for transcribing Bengali speech with various regional dialects, following the orthography set by linguists. The provided speech corpus consists of spontaneous speech from individuals with different regional dialects from ten different geographical locations in Bangladesh.

## Challenge Highlights
- Current technology struggles to accurately understand Bengali dialects, highlighting the need for improved speech recognition systems.
- The provided dataset and tools aim to contribute to the development of more inclusive and effective speech recognition systems for Bengali dialects.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebook**: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Output CSV Files**: CSV files containing the transcribed Bengali speech with regional dialects.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and generate results.
4. Review the output CSV files containing the transcribed Bengali speech.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the organizers of the "IUT ICT Fest 2024 Datathon" and the creators of the "ভাষা-বিচিত্রা: ASR for Regional Dialects" competition on Kaggle for providing the opportunity to work on this challenging problem.
